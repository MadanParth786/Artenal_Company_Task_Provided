A look at the data

Before we dive into the algorithm, letâ€™s take a look at our data. Each row in

the data contains information on how a player performed in the 2013-2014

NBA season.

Here are some selected columns from the data:

player - name of the player

pos - the position of the player

g - number of games the player was in

gs - number of games the player started

pts - total points the player scored

There are many more columns in the data, mostly containing information

about average player game performance over the course of the season.
