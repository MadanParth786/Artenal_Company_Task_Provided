In this assignment, you will be using the K-nearest neighbors

algorithm to predict how many points NBA players scored in the 2013-2014

season.

A look at the data

Before we dive into the algorithm, let’s take a look at our data. Each row in

the data contains information on how a player performed in the 2013-2014

NBA season.

Here are some selected columns from the data:

player - name of the player

pos - the position of the player

g - number of games the player was in

gs - number of games the player started

pts - total points the player scored

There are many more columns in the data, mostly containing information

about average player game performance over the course of the season.

See this site for an explanation of the rest of them.
